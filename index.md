Hello there, I'm Aditya, a third-year undergraduate at IIT Bombay. My major is in **Mechanical Engineering** and my minor is in **Computer Science**. I like wordgames, cycling, listening to music and football. I've also been bitten by the travel bug since I was a child, and there's nothing I'd love better than exploring the world.  
My primary interests lie in the field of **applied machine learning**, concentrated towards but not restricted to the field of finance. For the summer of 2021, I will be interning as a  Summer Analyst at Faering Capital, one of India's leading private equity firms.
