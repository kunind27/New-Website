			<h2>Teaching</h2>
		</header>
		<blockquote> "Good teaching is one-fourths preparation and three-fourths theatre." - Gail Godwin
		</blockquote>
		<p> I've had the privilege of being a teaching assistant for a few courses so far during my short stay at IIT Bombay.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>MA 214 - Numerical Analysis</b> (Spring 2021, Prof. S. Mazumdar, Prof. H. Hutridurga): If you're taking this course in the current semester, you might find some useful stuff <a href="http://bit.ly/ma214-2021">here</a>. As the course picks up, you should be able to find the following in this folder: weekly problem sets and their solutions, extra reading material and (possibly) some past papers.
			<li> <b>ME 219 - Fluid Mechanics</b> (Autumn 2020, Prof. A. Sridharan): As a TA for this online course, I handled the administrative elements and logistics of the class. I was also responsible for the conduct and grading of weekly quizzes as well as term exams. It was a very different experience compared to some of my earlier sojourns into teaching, but enjoyable nevertheless. If you are an undergraduate student taking this course, you may find some resources <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SKE9o1peqAWLPQYtmB1fy8xp8zB0-FNk">here</a>. </li>
			<li> <b>ME 119 - Engineering Graphics and Drawing</b> (Spring 2020, Prof. A. Agrawal): My role included reviewing problem sets to be provided to the students, solving and subsequently grading them - all on a weekly basis. You can find problem sets, solutions and marking guidelines <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jKxjDiQwlpewWzul_nMjll318yU8TQFn">here</a>. </li>
			<li> <b>MA 108 - Ordinary Differential Equations</b> (Summer 2019, Prof. G.K. Srinivasan): This position entailed mentoring and conducting tutorial sessions for a batch of 20 academically underperforming students over three weeks and grading weekly quizzes and an end-semester exam. Prof. Srinivasan had provided some excellent notes on the subject, replete with historical commentary. They can be found <a href="Notes.pdf">here</a>. </li>

			<h2>Courses Taken</h2>
		</header>
		<p> While I do enjoy teaching, the reason I'm at IITB is because I'm a student. As a student, I've taken several interesting 'real-world' courses at IITB. Here is an exhaustive list, as of Spring 2020. May I also take this opportunity to redirect you to another website I'm maintaining, the <a href="https://mechdampiitb.github.io/">DAMP blog</a> for the Department of Mechanical Engineering, a one-stop for course reviews and other department-related experiences :). Go there after you've completed stalking me, the reason you were here in the first place.

			<h2>Online Courses</h2>
		</header>
		<p> The Covid-19 Lockdown provided me a golden chance to expose myself to a variety of online resources, most of which have been instrumental for me to narrow down on a domain of interest. Here is a selection of the courses/specializations I've completed (almost all of them were done in the long, dreary Summer of 2020).
